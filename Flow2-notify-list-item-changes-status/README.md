# DSR Step 2: notify when status of request is changed to 'In Progress'

## Summary
This is the second of two Power Automate Flows that are used by the Mercy Corps' Data Protection and Privacy team (DPP) to handle data subject requests. This flow completes two actions when the Data Subject Request form owner has reviewed a new request (generated by DSR Step 1) in the specified SharePoint list and changed the value of the **Status** column from `New` to `In Progress`:
1. sends notification email to specified address (system owner) with data subject name, request, and link to data subject request list with instructions to update, and
2. sends the same notification information via a Teams chat.

On it's own, it can be used to generate notifications when an element of a Sharepoint list is changed. Together with the other flow in this repo, we can efficiently create data subject requests; send notifications to various system holders across our organization; and track the compliance of each system owner with the request. If we are audited, our flow provides detailed data concerning all actions taken to comply with the request.

## Features
This sample Flow illustrates the following concepts:

* Modification of a SharePoint list item
* Conditions
* Sending an email
* Posting a Teams message in a chat

## Prerequisites
This flow requires a [List in SharePoint](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/introduction-to-lists-0a1c3ace-def0-44af-b225-cfa8d92c52d7). You will need to map form fields from the list  to the body of the notification (e.g. name of requestor). This example uses the following list fields to populate content in the notifications: `Name`, `Status`, and `request`.
